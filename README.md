## Prerequisites

Before you can start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (preferably Python 3)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional but recommended)

## Frontend Setup

To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Change directory to the frontend folder:

cd frontend

3. Install the required dependencies:

npm install

## Backend Setup

Setting up the backend is also straightforward. Here's how you can do it:

1. Change directory to the backend folder:

cd your-project-name/backend

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Django and other backend dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Perform initial database migrations:

python manage.py migrate

## Running the Application

Now that both the frontend and backend are set up, you can run the application. Follow these steps:

1. Start the backend Django server:

python manage.py runserver

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:

cd your-project-name/frontend
npm run start

You're all set! You now have a working development environment for the [Your Project Name] project. Feel free to make changes and contributions as needed.
